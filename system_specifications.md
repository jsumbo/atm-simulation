ATM Simulation - Software Specification Document
1. Introduction
The ATM Simulation is a console-based application implemented in Python. It's designed to mimic a subset of functions typically found in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The software is intended for educational use and to demonstrate basic programming concepts.

2. System Overview
The system simulates an ATM interface and supports the following operations:

PIN Verification
Balance Checking
Deposit
Withdrawal
Transaction Continuation
The system is designed to be run in a console or terminal environment.

3. System Operations
3.1 PIN Verification
The system prompts the user for a PIN (Personal Identification Number) when the program starts. The correct PIN is hardcoded as '1234'. If the user enters the correct PIN, they gain access to the ATM operations. If the user enters an incorrect PIN, the system displays an "Invalid PIN" message.

3.2 Balance Checking
Once the PIN has been verified, the system allows the user to check their account balance. The initial balance is hardcoded as 1000 units.

3.3 Deposit
The system allows the user to deposit a certain amount. This amount is added to the account balance. The user is then shown their updated balance.

3.4 Withdrawal
The system allows the user to withdraw a certain amount. If the requested withdrawal amount is greater than the current account balance, the system displays an "Insufficient funds" message and does not modify the account balance. If the requested amount is less than or equal to the current balance, the amount is deducted from the account balance. The user is then shown their updated balance.

3.5 Transaction Continuation
After performing an operation (balance check, deposit, or withdrawal), the system asks the user if they want to perform another transaction. If the user opts to perform another transaction, the system displays the operations menu again. If the user decides not to perform another transaction, the system displays a goodbye message and terminates.

4. System Requirements
The system requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or packages are needed.

5. Running the Program
To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute python atm_simulation.py from the terminal. Replace atm_simulation.py with the actual filename of the Python script.
